One of the workarounds we landed on was to build a golden image for a Ubuntu 22.04 OS. Since there is thechance that this will be needed often for multiple students in the future I wanted to begin automating the process of creating multiple ec2 instances and dive into some IaC.</description></item><item><title>AWS and awscli</title><link>https://jwoolbright.com/learning/aws/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 15:46:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jwoolbright.com/learning/aws/</guid><description>Description After completing the Linux module the next building block for learners will be AWS. The focus of the module will be the following:

The reason I decided on Github actions was simply because of the seamless integration within github. I plan on working through more ci/cd tools in the future but this was a good start and learning experience for me.
What I wanted to accomplish:
Perform action on merge into master branch Have the action complete the following tasks: Checkout master branch Install framework on runner Build project Secure copy files to server Requirements:</description></item></channel></rss>
